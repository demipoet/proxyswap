# About Proxyswap

## Protocol, Interface, Studio

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Proxyswap", some of which may confuse new users.

* [Proxy Studio](https://warpcast.com/proxystudio.eth):  The open venture studio which developed the Proxyswap protocol in collaboration with [FBI](https://warpcast.com/\~/channel/fbi)
* The Proxyswap Protocol: A suite of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of ERC-20 tokens on the [DegenChain](https://bridge.degen.tips/) L3 blockchain. Proxyswap’s smart contracts are forked from [Uniswap V3](https://github.com/Uniswap/docs/blob/main/docs/contracts/v3/overview.md) protocol.
* The Proxyswap Interface: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Proxyswap protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the Proxyswap protocol. The Github repository for the Proxyswap interface is opensourced and linked [here](https://github.com/makerdock/proxyswap). Proxyswap’s smart contracts are forked from [Uniswap V3](https://github.com/Uniswap/docs/blob/main/docs/contracts/v3/overview.md) protocol.
* Proxyswap DAO: $PROXY is the native token of the DAO, and facilitates governance, which is conducted directly on Farcaster using Vocdoni’s communities tool. The Proxyswap DAO Community page on Vocdoni is linked [here](https://farcaster.vote/app/#/communities/12).

Please note that as the Proxyswap protocol v 0.1 is currently an identical fork of Uniswap V3 protocol, most of the documentation and concepts implemented in the DEX are the same.

## Future Vision

Our mission is to onboard users, teams and liquidity onto “degenchain” with a feature-rich trading platform fully integrated and informed by sufficiently decentralized social networks.

Proxywap was deployed for, and by Degens.
