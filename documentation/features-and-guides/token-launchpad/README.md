# Token Launchpad

Create your token via Proxyswap's Launchpad with the benefit of several features:&#x20;

ðŸ”¹ **Single-Sided Liquidity**: provide liquidity on a single-sided pool - no pairs needed.

ðŸ”¹ **LP Locker**: Lock a portion of your token's Liquidity Pool, preventing it to be withdrawn for a set period of time (aka no sudden rug-pulls).

ðŸ”¹ **Claiming Fees from locked LP**: While your liquidity is locked, any fees generated from trades in the pool will be available for you to claim.

We've developed this mechanism to help projects build trust by ensuring liquidity is available for trading while still rewarding liquidity providers for their contributions.

Here are the main features

* [launch.md](launch.md "mention")
* [airdrops.md](airdrops.md "mention")
* [claim.md](claim.md "mention")
* [lock.md](lock.md "mention")
