## News and Articles

#### Proxyswap v2.1 is now LIVE!

> **New on v2.1**&#x20;
>
> üîπ **Token Launchpad** - create & airdrop tokens, with the following features: üîπ Single-Sided Liquidity: provide liquidity with even a singular token - no pairs needed.
>
> üîπ **Locked Liquidity**: the liquidity you provide will be locked and cannot be withdrawn for a set period (aka no sudden rug-pulls).
>
> üîπ **Trading Fees**: While your liquidity is locked, any fees generated from trades in the pool will be available for you to claim.
>
> We've developed this mechanism to help projects build trust by ensuring liquidity is available for trading while still rewarding liquidity providers for their contributions.
